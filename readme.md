# Halcyon
Halcyon is a mod for [PMDO](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/) created by Palika that aims to recapture the vibes and energy of Explorers in an all-new original adventure.
It currently consists of 4 chapters. 
A final length of 10-12 chapters is currently planned.

## To install and play
1. [Download and install PMDO](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/releases) if you have not already.
2. Download Halcyon as a zip file from the [Github project releases](https://github.com/Palikadude/Halcyon/releases). The latest release should be the most stable one.
3. Extract the Halcyon zip file to its own folder.
4. Place extracted Halcyon folder into PMDO's MODS folder. The exact file path changes depending on where you put PMDO, but it should go something like PMDO/MODS/Halcyon in the end.
5. Make sure Halcyon is not embedded an extra folder down! When you click on Halcyon's folder in your MODS folder, it should have the readme file in plain sight, and not in another folder!
6. Start PMDO, and select Halcyon from the main menu via Special Episodes.

If you're having trouble installing the game, or have any questions, comments, feedback, etc., please join the [PMDO discord](https://discord.gg/37VKndMsr2) and talk with Palika there! The dedicated channel for Halcyon discussion is #quest-halcyon.



## FAQ
1. I'm having a weird audio stuttering issue! How can I fix it?
* If you're encountering this issue, you'll need to run PMDO with the following command line argument to force it to use a different audio driver: -audiodriver:wasapi
* If you don't know how to this, look in the Halcyon Mods folder and put the audio-wasapi.bat file into the same folder as your PMDO.exe, then use the .bat file to boot the game instead of the .exe file.
