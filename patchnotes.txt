V 0.3.0,
Initial public demo release. 



V 0.4.0
- Added two mods you can enable on top of Halcyon! Know that they are not compatible with each other right now due to technical limitations. If you want both, simply use all starters when you start a new game, then toggle it off and toggle no nicknames on as soon as you can save your game.
  To use these mods, drag the folder of the mod in the Halcyon Mods folder into the overal PMDO mods folder, then activate the mod on the main menu under Mods.
  - No nicknames: Changes the names of NPCs to their species names, for people who prefer that over the custom names they had.
  - All Starters: Allows you to pick ANY pokemon as a starter and partner! Allows more customization options as well with regards to egg moves and abilities.
		  Please note that if there are no sprites for that Pokemon, they can't be selected.
		  Please also note that this may cause certain cutscenes to look strange if the Pokemon chosen as a starter/partner lacks an animation.
		  Furthermore, this mod may be a bit buggy; please report any issues with starter pokemon to Palika.
- Improved outlaw spawning code from Trio-
- Fixed Domi Blend displaying a belly fill message (it should do that silently)
- Fixed Apple Cider NOT displaying a belly fill message (it should say your belly was filled)
- Added a new UI to the cafe drink system that should be much more convenient for players.
- Added a new drink to the cafe that unlocks in Chapter 4. Endurance Tonic costs a Reviver Seed and a Chesto Berry and gives the consumer 5 turns of Endure status, preventing their HP from going below 1. Unlike the usual endure effect given by the move, this one is not cleared by moving.
- Two new training mazes unlock in Chapter 4, Flying and Rock.
- Lars will now sell colored and plain Apricorns once Chapter 4 starts. He'll sell one guaranteed a day. 
- Rhizo will also have a chance to sell plain and colored Apricorns once Chapter 4 starts.
- Fixed Water Maze's element being Fire and not Water.
- Espurr, Meowth-A, Popplio, Charcadet, Tepig, and Zorua-H are added as starters. Check pokemon changes file to see some changes to Espurr's and Charcadet's level up table, as well as the changes to Zorua-H.
- Fixed a bug where a client pokemon with temporary water privileges (i.e. water sport) being beamed out while on water caused an error.
- Adjusted logic for turning towards a specified location, this should make certain scripted character turns better at looking in the proper direction when turning to look at a location.
- Fixed a number of minor typos.
- Time Gear Remix has been replaced with an original composition by Minemaker0430. Thank you again!
- Hunger seeds in Crooked Cavern have been replaced with Decoy seeds. These should help with the unique challenges that dungeon provides.
- Slightly reduced the first boss leader's stats.
- Significantly reduced a certain Hypnosis user's Speed stat. This will make her more likely to miss her Hypnosis as well as easier to land attacks on.
- Adjusted a certain moron's stat EVs. This ends up giving him less Atk and Sp. Atk, but more Speed, Def. and Sp. Def.
- Changed some starter movesets around a bit to allow certain mons to get STAB moves earlier on. Check pokemon changes file for details.
- Added a QoL message that warns you when leaving a floor with an incomplete job.
- Improve Fleeing Outlaw AI to be less cheesable.
- The range at which certain enemies are allowed to use moves from has been reduced. This should prevent unfair sniping from certain enemies early on in the game.
- Added scarf sprites for Mudkip. It seems I had accidentially passed over him when I first added all the scarf pokemon I had sprites for.
- Added certain actions that happen mid sentence, now that the [script] tag is available. This has been added throughout the game here and there, where appropriate. Typically used to have a character hop at the end of a sentence.
- Added plot-based goals to Mission Objectives, ala Explorers. If you're in the current story dungeon, Mission Objectives now has a non-generic line telling you what the objective is instead of just "Go as far as you can."
- Power Band, Def. Scarf, Special Band, and Zinc Band all boost their respective stat by 20% now instead of 10%.
- Fixed a bug where Exploration missions didn't have their difficulty increased.
- Lowered base price of Stayaway Orb from 150 to 50.
- Nerfed gummi spawn rates in shops, the cafe, and mission rewards by about half. Dungeon rates are unchanged, but may be adjusted in the future.
- Added the ability to eat gummis and stat boosters in the overworld (thank you Trio-)
- Added a new Adventuring Tip to Almotz's almanac.
- Revamped internal logic for Cafe Specials and added a more updated system for determining which item to pick.
- Fixed a display bug in the pokemon's info menu when a scarf sprite was being used.
- Fixed Kecleon's not leaning over their counter when talking to them.
- Fixed fail result in Relic Forest not giving a results screen.
- Added a Store All option to Kanga in town. This option won't store your equipped items, be aware.
- Fixed a display bug for Apple Cider in the ferment prompt.
- Fixed a bug where outlaws would spawn with no moves.
- Fixed cheri bombs not working due to a PMDO issue.
- Tweaked some wording in the cafe to prevent an issue where you'd get "a (vowel)" on fermented item get.
- Fixed an issue where finishing/losing in Ledian Dojo would cause the ground to not setup in the same way that it would had you entered in the map from the ladder.
- Fixed an issue where generic win/lose scenes in Ledian Dojo would cause background NPCs to not animate correctly. 
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't store items at Kanga if the only items you had were equipped to someone.
- Fixed a bug where losing in Relic Forest Round 2 would skip you to the last floor of the backtrack.
- Fixed a bug where an invalid item type was trying to be rewarded (golden spike instead of golden thorn)
- Fixed an issue where pokemon that spawn past the initial set on a MH outlaw floor would be marked as a goon.
- Adjusted the logic for outlaw moveset; they now have 4 random moves they can know at that level, minus any moves that are blacklisted (teleport, OHKO moves, etc.)
